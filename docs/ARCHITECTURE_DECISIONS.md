# Architecture Decisions (Locked)

1. Determinism over performance
2. No floating point in consensus or state
3. HotStuff-like BFT, original implementation
4. Explicit state machine boundaries
5. Canonical encoding for all wire/state formats
6. License safety enforced by tooling
7. Minimal dependencies
8. Signals-only AI integration
9. Cryptography isolated in its own crate
10. Networking isolated from consensus
11. Test vectors required for formats
12. Clean-room provenance preserved
