# NOVAI — Clean-Room L1 Blockchain

This repository is a **clean-room rewrite** of the NOVAI L1 blockchain.

## Status
- Week 1: clean-room baseline, licensing gates, hello-node networking
- No consensus logic implemented yet
- No AI inference in consensus (signals-only design)

## Non-Negotiable Principles
- Clean-room implementation (no copied protocol code)
- Deterministic execution
- License-safe dependency graph (GPL/AGPL forbidden)
- Spec-first, test-first development

See `docs/CLEANROOM_POLICY.md` for binding rules.
